In the heart of a forgotten village nestled between the shadowy hills and the ancient forest, stood an old clocktower. For generations, it had marked the hours with its deep, metallic chimes—loud and deliberate, echoing through the silent fields like the heartbeat of time itself. But now, the villagers had all gone. The homes were empty, the roads overgrown, and the once-bustling square lay buried in dust and weeds. Only the clocktower remained, still ticking, still chiming, as if unaware that no one was left to hear it.

Legends whispered that the tower was alive—not in the literal sense, but in the way it seemed to remember. The wind that spiraled around its stone frame carried murmurs, voices that had once laughed, cried, shouted, whispered. Some said the tower was built on the ruins of an ancient chapel, others claimed it was cursed by a watchmaker who had poured his soul into the gears to keep them turning long after his death.

One cold evening in late autumn, a traveler named Elias stumbled upon the village. The map he carried did not mark it, and no road signs mentioned its name. But he had followed the rhythmic chime, distant yet distinct, cutting through the fog like a beacon. Exhausted, he approached the tower, drawn to it not out of curiosity, but as though something had been calling him all along.

He pushed open the heavy wooden doors, creaking on rusted hinges, and stepped into a room thick with dust and silence. The gears above turned slowly, methodically. Despite its age, the mechanism was flawless. No cobwebs clung to its teeth, no dust hindered its motion. Time, in this place, had not faltered.

Elias ascended the spiral staircase. With every step, memories not his own flickered at the edges of his mind—a child's laughter, a scream, the scent of burning paper. He reached the top platform and looked out across the ghostly village. The fog swallowed the rooftops. The air was still.

And then the clock struck the hour.
